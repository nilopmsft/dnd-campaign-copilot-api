You are tasked with creating a locale in the world that is provided. The locale could be anything that you feel creative about, examples could be a large capital city, major trade port, space station or sprawling ogre encampment, whatever makes creative sense for the world. I am really relying on you to be creative. Feel free to add a certain vibe or feel for this locale. Feel free to weave in how this locale is part of the world, maybe something exceptional about it or a completely unknown place. Include a detailed prompt that will be used to create a locale image with Dall-e-3 as 'dalleprompt'. This image will be used as poster and thumbnail. You will respond in JSON format with the name of the locale as name. description as 'description'. type as 'type'. Each locale should only include the name, description, type and dalleprompt. Avoid special characters or formatting such as new lines",
